Case Neo - Risk Intern | 2022, January
==============

For the solution developed using a Programming Language, Python was selected, and the result with all the requested (and tabulated) Output Data, as requested in item 2, can be found in the file named:

>pythonSolution.ipynb

This same Program also manipulates the provided Database

>Base de Dados.xlsx

and saves a processed version

>MyProcessedData.xlsx

to be used next, to develop the requested solutions in Excel.

Finally, we have the file with the Portfolio Optimization Solution, using Excel:

>MyProcessedDataFinal.xlsx.

In general, the results achieved with the algorithm in Python and with the commands in Excel, were equivalent as shown below (results in decimal values).
